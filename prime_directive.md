## 📊 Live Directive Compliance KPI (Session-Level)

Use a live compliance score throughout every working session to make adherence observable and auditable in real time.

### KPI Score Model

**Score format:** `X/6 green`

- **Green** = Requirement satisfied and evidenced in this session
- **Yellow** = Not yet applicable or pending the relevant step
- **Red** = Violated; must be flagged and corrected before continuing

### Required KPI Checklist (Track Live)

1. **Track directive compliance live**
2. **Verify venv before Python actions** (Principle 0)
3. **Confirm baseline tests pass clean** (Principle 1)
4. **Require post-change tests clean** (Principle 1)
5. **Enforce UI manual smoke checks** for UI changes (Principle 5)
6. **Record compliance status in updates**

### Session Reporting Protocol

- Report the KPI score in progress updates and handoffs
- Update checklist state immediately after each meaningful action
- If any item turns **Red**, stop new implementation work, fix the issue, then resume
- If an item is **Yellow**, state what trigger/action will move it to **Green**

### Checkpoint Cadence Rule (Mandatory)

Append an entry to `session_log.md` at the following minimum cadence:

1. **Session Start** - before implementation begins
2. **Environment/Test Gate** - after venv verification and baseline test run
3. **Each Major Implementation Cycle** - after meaningful code changes and their verification
4. **Every Test Execution** - when running targeted tests or full suite tests
5. **Any State Change to Red** - immediately when a violation is detected, plus correction outcome
6. **Session Handoff/Close** - final status and next steps

**Checkpoint metadata required per entry:**
- Checkpoint type (start, test, implementation, risk, handoff)
- Trigger event (what caused this entry)
- KPI delta (what changed since prior entry)

**Guideline:** prefer more frequent short entries over infrequent large summaries.

### Session Log File Requirement (Per Project)

Every project must maintain a dedicated session log file at repository root:

- **Required file:** `session_log.md`
- **Created when:** project initialization (or first work session if missing)
- **Updated when:** at session start, after major checkpoints, and at handoff/close

**Minimum entry fields:**

1. Date and session identifier
2. Directive Compliance KPI score (`X/6 green`)
3. Green/Yellow/Red breakdown with reasons
4. Checkpoint type and trigger event
5. KPI delta since previous entry
6. Actions completed since last entry
7. Risks, blockers, or corrective actions
8. Next planned steps

**Bootstrap instructions for new projects:**

1. Create `session_log.md` at repo root
2. Add a reusable entry template with KPI checklist fields
3. Add first baseline entry before implementation begins
4. Continue appending entries chronologically (newest at bottom)

**Rule:** if a session performs work and `session_log.md` is not updated, session compliance is incomplete.

### Example Status Update

```markdown
Directive Compliance KPI: 4/6 green
- Green: #1, #2, #3, #6
- Yellow: #4 (awaiting post-change test run), #5 (no UI change yet)
- Red: none
```

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 0. **Virtual Environment Verification - ALWAYS FIRST**
**CRITICAL:** Before ANY pip install, pytest, or Python execution, VERIFY you are in the virtual environment.

**The Protocol:**
1. ✅ **Check Python path** - run `python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"`
2. ✅ **Verify it points to project venv** - path should contain `\pp2-practice-bot\Scripts\python.exe`
3. ❌ **If using global Python** - path will be `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\...`
4. ✅ **Activate venv if needed** - run `.\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows) or `source Scripts/activate` (Unix) **AS A SEPARATE COMMAND**
5. ✅ **Re-verify after activation** - check Python path again to confirm activation worked

**IMPORTANT - Activation Must Be Separate:**
```powershell
# ❌ WRONG - Chaining activation with other commands doesn't work
.\Scripts\Activate.ps1; python -c "..."  # Activation doesn't persist!

# ✅ CORRECT - Run activation first, then run subsequent commands separately
# Command 1: Activate
.\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Command 2: Verify (in next command)
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"

# Command 3: Now run your work (in next command)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why Separate Commands?**
- PowerShell activation scripts modify the current session environment
- Chaining with semicolons creates sub-shells that don't persist environment changes
- Each terminal command invocation is a fresh session unless activation is explicit

**Background Tasks and Virtual Environments:**
```powershell
# ❌ WRONG - Background tasks start NEW sessions without venv
python -m streamlit run app.py  # If run as background, uses global Python!

# ✅ CORRECT - Use Scripts executables directly for background tasks
.\Scripts\streamlit.exe run app.py  # Works without activation!
.\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest test_file.py  # Explicit venv Python

# ✅ ALSO CORRECT - Activate first, then run in foreground/same session
.\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Command 1
python -m streamlit run app.py  # Command 2 in same session
```

**Key Insight - Scripts Executables:**
- When packages install in venv, they create executables in `.\Scripts\` directory
- These executables (`.exe`, `.cmd`) know their Python environment path automatically
- Using `.\Scripts\executable.exe` works from ANY session (activated or not)
- Examples: `streamlit.exe`, `pytest.exe`, `python.exe`, `pip.exe`
- **Benefit:** No activation needed when using direct paths to Scripts executables

**When to Use Each Method:**

| Scenario | Method | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Background task (server, watch mode) | Direct Scripts path | `.\Scripts\streamlit.exe run app.py` |
| Quick one-off command | Direct Scripts path | `.\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest` |
| Multiple sequential commands | Activate once, then run | Activate → run command 1 → run command 2 |
| Interactive work session | Activate once | Activate → work with `python`, `pip`, etc. |

**❌ NEVER:**
- Run `pip install` without checking Python path first
- Assume the environment is active because it "should be"
- Install packages into global Python (pollutes base environment)
- Run tests or code with global Python when venv exists
- Chain activation with other commands using semicolons (`;`)
- Run background tasks assuming they inherit venv activation
- Try to install packages when tests already passed (indicates packages exist!)

**✅ ALWAYS:**
- Run activation as a standalone command first (if not using Scripts paths)
- Verify Python executable path AFTER activation in a new command
- Use `.\Scripts\executable.exe` for background tasks or when activation is unclear
- Check for venv indicators: `(venv)` or `(pp2-practice-bot)` prompt prefix
- Verify packages exist before attempting installation (check `pip list` or test results)
- Document which environment was used if reporting issues

**Recovery from Global Install:**
```powershell
# Uninstall from global Python
python -m pip uninstall package1 package2 -y

# Activate venv
.\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Verify venv is active
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"  # Should show ...\pp2-practice-bot\Scripts\python.exe

# Install to venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1. **100% Test Pass Rate + Zero Warnings - Non-Negotiable**
All tests must pass AND produce zero warnings before AND after ANY code changes. No exceptions.

**MANDATORY: Tests Must Exist Before Code Changes**
- ❌ **Never make code changes without test coverage**
- ✅ **Write tests FIRST for new features (TDD)**
- ✅ **Add tests IMMEDIATELY when fixing bugs**
- ✅ **Create test file alongside new modules**
- ❌ **Never commit untested code** - tests prevent regressions

**The Protocol:**
1. ✅ Verify baseline - run full test suite BEFORE any changes (zero failures, zero warnings)
2. 🔄 Make changes (one logical step at a time)
3. ✅ **Run tests IMMEDIATELY** after changes (zero failures, zero warnings)
4. ❌ If tests fail OR warnings appear - fix immediately or revert
5. ✅ **Backend tests pass = Server logic correct** (necessary but not sufficient for UI changes)
6. ✅ **For UI changes: Add manual testing** (see Principle 5)
7. ✅ Only commit when tests pass + manual verification complete (if UI changed)

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- **Backend routes:** Test all HTTP endpoints (GET, POST, error cases)
- **Business logic:** Test all functions with edge cases (empty, None, boundary values)
- **Integration:** Test complete workflows end-to-end
- **Error handling:** Test invalid inputs return proper errors
- **Minimum coverage:** 70%+ for new features, 90%+ for critical paths

**Warning Policy:**
- Warnings are NOT acceptable - they must be investigated and resolved
- Every warning indicates a potential issue (deprecations, type mismatches, anti-patterns)
- "Just warnings" become breaking errors in future versions
- Warnings create technical debt and mask real issues
- Zero tolerance for warnings = clean, maintainable codebase

**❌ Never:**
- Skip baseline verification
- Ignore or dismiss warnings as "not important"
- Make multiple unrelated changes at once
- Commit with failing tests OR warnings
- Defer fixing test failures or warnings
- Delete code without verifying impact

**✅ Always:**
- Run tests before starting work (establish baseline: X passed, 0 warnings)
- Run tests after each logical change
- Maintain 100% pass rate AND zero warnings throughout
- Investigate every warning immediately when it appears
- Fix warnings before proceeding with new work
- Document test count AND warning count in commits (e.g., "393 passed, 0 warnings")
- Preserve git history when removing code

### 2. **Verify First, Code Second**  
Never assume how existing code works. Always verify before implementing.

**❌ Don't:**
```python
# Assuming without checking
timeframe=TimeFrame.DAILY  # Does DAILY exist?
def on_bar(self, symbol, bar):  # Is this the right signature?
```

**✅ Do:**
```python
# Step 1: Check existing code
# grep_search(query="class TimeFrame", includePattern="data_models.py")
# read_file to see: DAY_1, HOUR_1, MINUTE_1

# Step 2: Use correct values
timeframe=TimeFrame.DAY_1
def on_bar(self, market_data):  # Matches base class signature
```

### 3. **Defensive Programming Always**  
Assume nothing. Handle None, validate inputs, check bounds.

**❌ Don't:**
```python
position = self.get_position(symbol)
if position <= 0:  # Crashes if None!
    ...
```

**✅ Do:**
```python
position = self.get_position(symbol) or 0  # Default to 0
if position <= 0:
    ...

# Or more explicit:
position = self.get_position(symbol)
if position is None:
    position = 0
```

### 4. **Test Incrementally, Not All At Once**  
Build and verify in small steps. Don't write 300 lines before testing.

**✅ Development Flow:**
```python
# Step 1: Test component in isolation
data_manager = HistoricalDataManager(data_dir)
data_manager.load_csv(...)
print(f"✓ Loaded {len(bars)} bars")  # Verify!

# Step 2: Test next component
strategy = MyStrategy(config)
strategy.on_start()  # Does it initialize?

# Step 3: Test integration
result = engine.run()  # Now combine them
```

### 5. **Frontend/UI Testing - The Backend Test Blind Spot**
**CRITICAL:** Backend tests (pytest, unittest) **CANNOT** catch frontend bugs. Know the gap.

**The Reality Check:**
- ✅ Backend tests verify: routes work, logic correct, data flows properly
- ❌ Backend tests **MISS**: JavaScript bugs, form behavior, UI interactions, browser rendering
- 🎯 **100% backend test pass ≠ working application from user perspective**

**What Backend Tests Don't Catch:**
1. **JavaScript Errors**
   - Form fields being cleared by JS
   - Event handlers not firing
   - Tab switching breaking functionality
   - Client-side validation issues
   - **CRITICAL: Syntax errors that break ALL JavaScript** (missing braces, semicolons)

2. **HTML Form Behavior**
   - Disabled fields don't submit their values (HTML spec behavior)
   - Form validation preventing submission
   - Field names not matching server expectations
   - Empty file inputs always present in request.files

3. **Browser-Specific Issues**
   - CSS breaking layout
   - Forms not submitting
   - AJAX requests failing
   - Event listeners not attaching

4. **User Flow Problems**
   - Confusing UX (buttons that don't work as expected)
   - Missing feedback (no loading indicators)
   - Error messages not displayed
   - Navigation breaks

**⚠️ SPECIAL DANGER: JavaScript Syntax Errors**
JavaScript syntax errors are **silent killers** that make debugging extremely difficult:

```javascript
// Bug example: Missing closing brace
if (inputForm) {
    inputForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        // ... lots of code ...
        return true;
    });
// ❌ MISSING } for if statement!
</script>

// Result:
// - Browser shows: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input"
// - ALL JavaScript after the error: DOESN'T RUN
// - Event handlers: NEVER REGISTERED
// - Console logs: NEVER APPEAR
// - Form: Falls back to plain HTML submission (no validation, no logging)
// - From user perspective: Form "doesn't work" with no clear error
```

**Why Syntax Errors Are Devastating:**
1. **Silent failure** - JavaScript stops executing, no obvious error to user
2. **All subsequent code disabled** - entire script block becomes useless
3. **Event handlers don't register** - buttons appear functional but don't work
4. **No logging output** - can't debug with console.log if code never runs
5. **Backend tests still pass** - they don't load JavaScript at all

**How to Catch JavaScript Syntax Errors:**
1. **Open browser console (F12)** before any manual test
2. **Look for red error messages** - "SyntaxError" is your clue  
3. **Check line numbers** - browser tells you exactly where the error is
4. **Fix syntax, hard refresh** - Ctrl+Shift+R to clear cached JavaScript
5. **Re-test** - verify error gone and functionality works

**⚠️ SPECIAL DANGER: Compounding Bugs (Multiple Bugs Masking Each Other)**
When multiple bugs exist simultaneously, they can hide each other:

**Example Cascade:**
```
Bug #1: Disabled form fields (don't submit values)
         ↓
Prevents testing → Bug #2: JavaScript syntax error (code doesn't run)
         ↓  
Can't reach server → Bug #3: if/elif logic bug (wrong branch executes)
         ↓
Each bug hides the next → Appears as single issue to user
```

**Debugging Compounding Bugs - Systematic Approach:**
1. **Start at the beginning** - browser loads page (console errors?)
2. **Check each layer in order:**
   - Browser console → any errors?
   - JavaScript logs → are they appearing?
   - Network tab → is request being sent?
   - Server logs → is request received?
   - Server processing → what's the data?
3. **Fix ONE bug at a time**
4. **Re-test after EACH fix** - don't assume you found "the" bug
5. **Repeat until workflow succeeds end-to-end**

**Cost of Compounding Bugs:**
- Single bug alone: 5-10 min to find
- Two bugs together: 15-30 min (each hides symptoms of the other)
- Three bugs together: 45+ min (exponential debugging difficulty)
- **Prevention: Manual testing catches ALL of them in 2 minutes**

**The Protocol - Web Applications:**

**After ANY UI Change (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):**
1. ✅ **Run backend tests** - ensure server-side still works (100% pass required)
2. ✅ **Manual smoke test** - actually use the application (MANDATORY)
3. ✅ **Check browser console** - no JavaScript errors (F12 DevTools)
4. ✅ **Test critical user flows** - can users complete key tasks?
5. ✅ **Verify on refresh** - state persists, no unexpected resets

**Manual Testing Checklist** (Required for UI changes):
```markdown
Critical User Flows (Test EVERY TIME):
- [ ] Submit form with valid data → reaches next page
- [ ] Submit form with invalid data → shows errors
- [ ] Navigate between pages → no data loss  
- [ ] Refresh page mid-workflow → state preserved (or reasonable fallback)
- [ ] Click all primary buttons → expected actions occur
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) → zero errors
- [ ] Mobile/responsive view → usable on small screens (if applicable)
```

**When to Add Browser-Based E2E Tests:**
Consider Selenium/Playwright if:
- Application has complex JS interactions (SPAs, real-time updates)
- UI bugs cause frequent customer escalations
- Team size > 3 developers making concurrent UI changes
- Application is customer-facing (not internal tool)

**Trade-offs:**
- **Backend tests:** Fast (seconds), reliable, catch logic bugs -  **miss UI bugs**
- **Manual testing:** Fast (minutes), catches UI bugs - **not automated, can be forgotten**
- **E2E browser tests:** Catch UI bugs, automated - **slow (minutes), brittle, maintenance overhead**

**For Small Projects/Internal Tools:**
- Prioritize: Backend tests (automated) + Manual checklist (discipline)
- Skip: E2E browser automation (too much overhead)
- Reason: Manual testing 5 critical flows takes 2-5 minutes vs hours maintaining E2E tests

**Red Flags That Indicate Missing Manual Testing:**
- ❌ "All 138 tests pass" but users report basic features broken
- ❌ Form submissions fail but tests don't catch it
- ❌ JavaScript console full of errors
- ❌ UI changes deployed without anyone actually clicking buttons

**❌ Never:**
- Deploy UI changes without manual smoke test
- Assume backend tests caught all issues
- Skip browser console error check
- Trust "it works on my machine" without verification

**✅ Always:**
- Manually test every UI change before commit
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Test critical user flows end-to-end
- Document UI testing in commit message ("Tested: form submission, navigation, refresh")
- Have second person spot-check if possible

### 6. **User-Facing Output Quality - No Truncated Business Content**
**CRITICAL:** Do not ship user-facing documents with truncated sentences (e.g., "...") unless explicitly labeled as a preview.

**Why this matters:**
- Business minutes are circulated as authoritative records
- Truncated content undermines clarity, professionalism, and legal/audit value
- "Looks fine" in UI can still be wrong in exported output

**✅ Always:**
- Ensure exported/printable MOM text includes full sentences
- If compact tables are used, wrap lines instead of truncating
- Only use ellipses in explicit previews, never in final export content

**Manual Output Check (Required when rendering changes):**
- Verify the final MOM text and PDF contain complete action items
- Confirm no ellipses appear in the final output (unless explicitly intended)

**Cost of Skipping Manual UI Testing:**
- 2 minutes saved = hours debugging production issues
- "100% test pass" gives false confidence
- Users discover bugs = credibility damage
- Regression bugs = wasted time

**Example Commit Message (Good):**
```
Fix word counter validation logic

- Changed minimum from 50 to 10 words
- Updated UI messaging to show "recommended" vs "required"
- Updated core/parser.py validation
- Updated tests/test_parser.py expectations

Backend Tests: 138/138 passed, 0 warnings ✓
Manual Testing: ✓
  - Submitted 10-word transcript → accepted
  - Submitted 5-word transcript → rejected with error
  - Word counter updates in real-time
  - Browser console: 0 errors
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Decision Matrix

**Quick Guide: What Testing Do I Need?**

| Change Type | Backend Tests | Manual UI Test | E2E Browser Tests | Time Investment |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Backend logic only** (API, core, data models) | ✅ Required | ❌ Not needed | ❌ Not needed | 5-15 min |
| **UI only** (CSS, static HTML) | ⚠️ Run existing | ✅ Required | ❌ Not needed | 2-5 min |
| **JavaScript/Forms** (interactions, validation) | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Consider for complex | 10-20 min |
| **Full-stack feature** (backend + frontend) | ✅ Required | ✅ Required | ⚠️ Consider for critical | 20-40 min |
| **Bug fix** (any layer) | ✅ Add regression test | ✅ Required if UI | ❌ Usually not needed | 10-30 min |

**Testing Type Definitions:**

1. **Backend Tests (pytest, unittest)**
   - **What:** Python tests that call functions/routes directly
   - **Catches:** Logic errors, data flow issues, API contract violations
   - **Misses:** JavaScript bugs, form behavior, browser rendering, user interactions
   - **Speed:** Fast (seconds to minutes)
   - **When:** Always for backend changes; run but don't add for pure UI changes

2. **Manual UI Testing**
   - **What:** Human clicking through the application in a browser
   - **Catches:** Broken forms, JS errors, layout issues, confusing UX
   - **Misses:** Race conditions, edge cases (manual testing is not exhaustive)
   - **Speed:** Fast (2-5 minutes for smoke test)
   - **When:** Required for ANY change that touches HTML/CSS/JavaScript

3. **E2E Browser Tests (Selenium, Playwright)**
   - **What:** Automated browser tests simulating user interactions
   - **Catches:** UI bugs, JS errors, integration issues (automated coverage)
   - **Misses:** Nothing significant (most comprehensive)
   - **Speed:** Slow (minutes to hours for full suite)
   - **When:** Complex UIs, multiple developers, customer-facing apps
   - **Trade-off:** High maintenance cost vs. manual testing discipline

**Decision Flowchart:**

```
Did I change backend code (Python)?
├─ YES → Write/update backend tests ✅
└─ NO → Run existing backend tests (smoke check) ⚠️

Did I change frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS)?
├─ YES → Manual UI test REQUIRED ✅
│        └─ Is it complex/critical user flow?
│           ├─ YES → Consider E2E tests 💭
│           └─ NO → Manual test sufficient ✅
└─ NO → Skip manual testing ❌

Is this a customer-facing production app?
├─ YES → Consider E2E test suite 💭
└─ NO (Internal tool) → Manual testing sufficient ✅
```

**For ClearMeet (Small Internal Tool):**
- ✅ Backend tests required (fast, automated)
- ✅ Manual UI testing required (2-5 min, catches most issues)
- ❌ E2E browser tests skipped (overhead > benefit for small team)

**When to Add E2E Tests:**
- Team size > 5 developers making concurrent UI changes
- Frequent customer escalations due to UI bugs
- Critical financial/healthcare application (high risk)
- Complex SPA with heavy JavaScript (React/Vue/Angular)

**When to Skip E2E Tests:**
- Small team (1-3 developers)
- Internal tools with few users
- Simple CRUD applications
- Manual testing discipline working well
- Limited time/budget for test maintenance

## 🔍 Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before writing ANY new code that uses existing classes/methods:

### ☑️ Research Phase (Mandatory)

#### For New Feature Implementation (TDD):
1. **Check Method Signatures**
   ```python
   # Use grep_search to find the method definition
   grep_search(query="def method_name", includePattern="filename.py")
   ```

2. **Verify Enum Values**
   ```python
   # Read the enum definition
   read_file("path/to/file.py", offset=line_number, limit=30)
   ```

3. **Inspect Data Structures**
   ```python
   # Check class attributes and properties
   grep_search(query="class ClassName", includePattern="*.py")
   list_code_usages(symbolName="ClassName")
   ```

4. **Find Usage Examples**
   ```python
   # See how others use this API
   grep_search(query="method_call.*pattern", isRegexp=True)
   ```

#### For Integration Tests of Existing Code (NEW):
**⚠️ CRITICAL: Research APIs BEFORE writing integration tests**

1. **List All Components to Integrate**
   ```python
   # Write down every class/module you'll test together
   # Example: StrategyLifecycle, PaperMetricsTracker, StrategyOrchestrator, RiskManager
   ```

2. **Find Existing Tests for Each Component**
   ```python
   # These tests show the CORRECT API usage
   grep_search(query="test.*ComponentName", includePattern="test_*.py")
   # Result: tests/test_component.py
   ```

3. **Read Existing Tests (API Documentation)**
   ```python
   # Read the test file completely
   read_file("tests/test_component.py")
   # Note ALL constructor signatures, method calls, return values
   # Pay special attention to:
   # - Parameter order (db_path first? strategy_name second?)
   # - Parameter count (5 params not 3?)
   # - Method names (get_report not validate?)
   # - Attribute names (overall_passed not passed?)
   # - Return types (dict not object? list not single item?)
   ```

4. **Verify Ambiguous Cases from Implementation**
   ```python
   # If existing tests don't clarify something, check source
   grep_search(query="class ComponentName", includePattern="*.py")
   read_file("path/to/component.py", offset=line, limit=50)
   ```

5. **Document API Reference in Comments**
   ```python
   # Create comprehensive API reference block at top of test file
   """
   API Reference (verified from existing tests):
   
   ComponentA (from test_component_a.py):
   - Constructor: ComponentA(param1: type, param2: type)
   - method1(arg1, arg2) -> return_type
   - attribute_name (not attribute_name_variant!)
   
   ComponentB (from test_component_b.py):
   - Constructor: ComponentB(db_path, name, initial_val) - db_path FIRST
   - method2(p1, p2, p3, p4, p5) - 5 params required!
   - Returns dict with keys: 'key1', 'key2' (not object)
   """
   ```

6. **Verify Integration Points**
   ```python
   # Check how components interact in existing code
   grep_search(query="ComponentA.*ComponentB", isRegexp=True)
   # Look for: data passing patterns, callback signatures, event handling
   ```

**Integration Test Research Checklist:**
- [ ] All components listed
- [ ] Existing tests found for each (test_*.py files)
- [ ] Existing tests read and APIs documented
- [ ] Constructor signatures verified (param order, types, required vs optional)
- [ ] Method signatures verified (names, param counts, return types)
- [ ] Attribute names verified (singular/plural, exact spelling)
- [ ] Enum values verified (actual values, not assumed)
- [ ] Integration patterns verified (how components interact)
- [ ] API reference comment block created
- [ ] Ambiguous cases checked in implementation
- [ ] Expected 80%+ first-run pass rate

**Time Investment:**
- API Research: 20-40 minutes (depends on component count)
- Test Writing: 40-60 minutes (faster with verified APIs)
- Debugging: 5-15 minutes (minimal with correct APIs)
- **Total: 65-115 minutes** (vs 180+ minutes without research)

**When to Skip Research:**
- Unit tests for code you just implemented (you know the API)
- Tests written alongside new implementation (TDD)
- You implemented the component recently (within same sprint)

### ☑️ Before Calling Any Method

- [ ] Checked the method signature (parameters, types, order)
- [ ] Verified return type (can it be None? Optional?)
- [ ] Checked for required imports
- [ ] Looked for existing usage examples
- [ ] Understood parameter types (enum vs string, int vs Optional[int])

### ☑️ Before Using Enums/Constants

- [ ] Verified actual enum value names (not assumed)
- [ ] Checked if it's a string enum or value enum
- [ ] Imported the enum properly

---

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Wrong Enum Values
**Problem:** Assuming enum names without checking
```python
TimeFrame.DAILY  # ❌ Doesn't exist
```
**Solution:** Always verify enum definitions
```python
TimeFrame.DAY_1  # ✅ Actual value
```
**Prevention:** Read enum source code first, add reference comment:
```python
# TimeFrame: DAY_1, HOUR_1, MINUTE_1, MINUTE_5, etc.
```

### Pitfall 2: Method Signature Mismatch
**Problem:** Implementing interface without checking base class
```python
def on_bar(self, symbol, bar):  # ❌ Wrong signature
```
**Solution:** Check abstract method in base class
```python
def on_bar(self, market_data):  # ✅ Matches Strategy base class
```
**Prevention:** Use `grep_search` to find base class method signature

### Pitfall 3: Attribute Name Assumptions
**Problem:** Guessing attribute names
```python
market_data.symbol  # ❌ It's plural!
```
**Solution:** Check class definition
```python
market_data.symbols  # ✅ Returns list
market_data.get_bar(symbol)  # ✅ Gets bar for symbol
```
**Prevention:** Read class docstrings and inspect attributes

### Pitfall 4: None Type Errors
**Problem:** Not handling None return values
```python
position = get_position(symbol)
if position > 0:  # ❌ Crashes if None
```
**Solution:** Always handle None explicitly
```python
position = get_position(symbol) or 0
if position > 0:  # ✅ Safe
```
**Prevention:** Check return type hints: `Optional[T]` means None is possible

### Pitfall 5: Parameter Type Confusion
**Problem:** Passing string where enum expected
```python
self.buy(symbol, quantity, "market order")  # ❌ String not OrderType
```
**Solution:** Use proper enum type
```python
self.buy(symbol, quantity, OrderType.MARKET)  # ✅ Enum
```
**Prevention:** Check method signature for parameter types

## 🛠️ Mandatory Tools Usage

### Before Implementation

| Task | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Find method definition | `grep_search` | `grep_search(query="def on_bar", includePattern="strategy.py")` |
| Read enum values | `read_file` | `read_file("data_models.py", offset=17, limit=30)` |
| Check class usage | `list_code_usages` | `list_code_usages(symbolName="Strategy")` |
| Find patterns | `grep_search` (regex) | `grep_search(query="TimeFrame\\.", isRegexp=True)` |
| Verify structure | `read_file` | `read_file("file.py", offset=50, limit=100)` |

### During Development

| Task | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Run tests | `run_in_terminal` | `python test_module.py` |
| Check errors | `get_errors` | `get_errors(filePaths=["path/to/file.py"])` |
| Verify changes | `read_file` | Read modified sections |

## 📋 Development Workflow (The Right Way™)

### Phase 1: Research (15-30% of time)
```
For New Feature Implementation:
1. Understand the requirement
2. Find relevant existing code
3. Check base classes and interfaces
4. Verify data structures and enums
5. Look for usage examples
6. Document findings in comments

For Integration Tests (ADDITIONAL - MANDATORY):
1. List ALL components to integrate
2. Find existing tests for EACH component (test_*.py)
3. Read existing tests COMPLETELY (note every API detail)
4. Verify constructor signatures (param order, types, counts)
5. Verify method signatures (names, params, return types)
6. Verify attribute names (exact spelling, singular/plural)
7. Verify integration patterns (how components interact)
8. Document comprehensive API reference in comments
9. Expected outcome: 80%+ first-run pass rate
```

**Integration Test Research is NON-NEGOTIABLE:**
- Skipping this step leads to 37+ API mismatches (Sprint 4 Task 1 experience)
- 30 minutes research saves 2 hours debugging
- Existing tests are your API documentation
- Write the API reference comment block BEFORE writing tests

### Phase 2: Design (10-15% of time)
```
1. Sketch out the implementation
2. Identify dependencies
3. Plan for error handling
4. Consider edge cases
5. Keep it simple initially
```

### Phase 3: Implementation (40-50% of time)
```
1. Start with minimal working code
2. Match signatures exactly
3. Add defensive checks (None, bounds, types)
4. Use proper types (enums, not strings)
5. Add logging/print statements for debugging
6. Keep functions small and focused
```

### Phase 4: Testing (20-30% of time)
```
1. Test each component in isolation
2. Add unit tests as you go
3. Run tests frequently (after each component)
4. Fix errors immediately - don't accumulate
5. Verify integration works
6. Run full test suite before committing
```

## ✅ Code Quality Standards

### Type Safety
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Use type hints
def calculate_position_size(
    self, 
    symbol: str, 
    price: float,
    fraction: Optional[float] = None
) -> int:
    ...

# ✅ GOOD: Handle Optional types
position: Optional[int] = self.get_position(symbol)
if position is None:
    position = 0
```

### Error Handling
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Validate inputs
if not symbol or symbol not in self.config.symbols:
    return

# ✅ GOOD: Check preconditions
if len(prices) < self.lookback_period:
    return  # Not enough data

# ✅ GOOD: Handle exceptions gracefully
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    log.warning(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    return default_value
```

### Documentation
```python
# ✅ GOOD: Document assumptions and constraints
def on_bar(self, market_data):
    """
    Process market data bar
    
    Note: MarketData.symbols is a list (plural)
    Note: get_position() returns Optional[int] - check for None!
    """
    for symbol in market_data.symbols:  # Note: plural!
        position = self.get_position(symbol) or 0  # Handle None
        ...
```

## 🎓 Learning from Errors

### ClearMeet Project: Frontend Testing Gap (February 16, 2026)

#### Lesson: Backend Tests Can't Catch JavaScript Bugs
**Context:** ClearMeet MOM generator - 138/138 tests passing, but users couldn't submit forms

**The Incident:**
- All 138 backend tests passing with 0 warnings ✓
- Application deployed confidently based on test results
- User reports: "Transcript text disappears when I click Generate MOM"
- Form submissions never reaching server - no POST requests logged
- Issue: JavaScript tab-switching code was **clearing form field values**

**Root Cause:**
```javascript
// Bug in templates/index.html
if (tabId === 'text-tab') {
    transcriptField.disabled = false;
    audioField.disabled = true;
    audioField.value = '';  // OK
} else {
    transcriptField.disabled = true;
    audioField.disabled = false;
    transcriptField.value = '';  // ❌ BUG: Clears user input!
}
```

**Why Tests Didn't Catch It:**
- Backend tests use `client.post('/process', data={...})` directly
- They **bypass** all HTML, JavaScript, and browser behavior
- Tests never execute tab-switching JS code
- Tests never interact with actual form elements
- 100% backend test pass ≠ working user interface

**The False Confidence:**
```bash
============================= 138 passed in 21.81s =============================
```
- Looked perfect ✓
- All routes working ✓
- All business logic correct ✓
- **But users couldn't use the app** ❌

**What We Should Have Done:**
1. ✅ Run backend tests (we did this)
2. ❌ **Manual smoke test** (we skipped this) → would have caught bug in 30 seconds
3. ❌ **Check browser console** (we skipped this) → might have shown errors
4. ❌ **Test critical flow** (we skipped this) → submit form, verify POST request

**The 2-Minute Test That Would Have Saved Hours:**
```markdown
Manual Smoke Test (skipped):
1. Open http://localhost:5000 in browser
2. Paste transcript in text field
3. Click "Generate MOM" button
4. Expected: redirect to /edit page
5. Actual: page refreshes, data gone
→ Bug discovered in 30 seconds
```

**Cost of Skipping Manual Test:**
- Time saved: 2 minutes
- Time spent debugging: 45+ minutes  
- User frustration: High
- Damage to test credibility: "Tests passed but app is broken"

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **"100% backend tests pass" ≠ "application works"**
   - Tests verify logic, not user experience
   - JavaScript bugs invisible to Python tests
   - Browser behavior not tested

2. **Manual testing is NOT optional for UI changes**
   - Takes 2-5 minutes
   - Catches 90% of UI bugs immediately
   - No excuses for skipping

3. **Always check browser console (F12)**
   - JavaScript errors show here
   - Network tab shows failed requests
   - Console logs show debugging info

4. **Add manual testing to commit messages**
   ```
   Fix: Enable form submission workflow
   
   Backend Tests: 138/138 passed ✓
   Manual Testing: ✓
     - Form submission works
     - POST request reaches server  
     - Redirects to /edit successfully
     - Browser console: 0 errors
   ```

5. **Consider where automated tests fall short**
   - Backend tests → fast, reliable, miss UI bugs
   - Manual testing → catches UI bugs, requires discipline
   - E2E browser tests → comprehensive, but expensive

**Action Items Implemented:**
1. ✅ Added Principle 5 to Prime Directive: "Frontend/UI Testing - The Backend Test Blind Spot"
2. ✅ Created manual testing checklist for UI changes
3. ✅ Added enhanced logging (server + client) for debugging
4. ✅ Fixed root cause: removed field value clearing in tab-switch code
5. ✅ Documented in commit with manual testing verification

**Key Quote:**
> "It's not exactly reassuring that the initial set of tests still let this issue happen"  
> — User feedback that exposed the testing blind spot

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Never deploy UI changes without manual smoke test
- Add "Manual Testing: ✓" section to commit messages for UI work
- Check browser console must be part of workflow
- Accept that some testing requires human interaction

**Long-term Consideration:**
- For larger teams/complex UIs: Consider Selenium/Playwright E2E tests
- For small projects/internal tools: Manual checklist + discipline is sufficient
- Trade-off: E2E test maintenance time vs manual testing time (usually manual wins for small projects)

### ClearMeet Project: Premature Commit and Compounding Bugs (February 16, 2026)

#### Lesson: "Fixed" Doesn't Mean Fixed - Three Bugs Masking Each Other
**Context:** ClearMeet MOM generator - committed "fix" that didn't actually work, required extensive debugging to find THREE separate bugs

**The Incident Timeline:**
1. **First commit (0e64b72):** "Fix form submission bug" - claimed to remove field clearing
2. **User test:** "Same problem persists" - form still not working
3. **Debugging discovery:** THREE separate bugs were present:
   - Bug #1: Disabled form fields (don't submit values)
   - Bug #2: JavaScript syntax error (missing closing brace)
   - Bug #3: if/elif logic bug in Python (audio field check always true)

**The Premature Commit:**
```bash
# What I thought I fixed:
- Removed transcriptField.value = '' and audioField.value = ''
- Added extensive logging
- Committed with confidence

# What I actually missed:
- Didn't test manually before committing
- Assumed code changes were correct without verification
- Trusted code review over actual execution
```

**The Three Compounding Bugs:**

**Bug #1: Disabled Form Fields**
```javascript
// templates/index.html
if (tabId === 'text-tab') {
    transcriptField.disabled = false;
    audioField.disabled = true;  // ❌ Disabled fields DON'T submit!
}
```
**Issue:** HTML specification - disabled form fields are excluded from form submission
**Hidden by:** Even if JavaScript worked, fields wouldn't submit
**Fix:** Removed all disabled logic, let server decide which input to use

**Bug #2: JavaScript Syntax Error**
```javascript
// templates/index.html - broken structure
if (inputForm) {
    inputForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
        // ... submission handler code ...
        return true;
    });
// ❌ MISSING CLOSING BRACE for if (inputForm) block!
</script>
```
**Error:** `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input (at (index):222)`
**Impact:** 
- Event handler never registered
- JavaScript failed silently
- Form did plain HTML submission (no validation, no logging)
- All console.log statements never executed
**Hidden by:** Bug #1 meant even if JS worked, form wouldn't submit values
**Fix:** Added missing `}` closing brace

**Bug #3: if/elif Logic Bug**
```python
# app.py - broken logic
if 'audio_file' in request.files:  # ❌ ALWAYS TRUE (field exists even when empty)
    audio_file = request.files['audio_file']
    if audio_file and audio_file.filename:  # Only processes if file uploaded
        transcript = transcribe_audio(...)
# elif never runs because outer if is always true!
elif 'transcript_text' in request.form:  # ❌ NEVER EXECUTES
    transcript = request.form['transcript_text']
```
**Issue:** Form fields always exist in request, even when empty
**Impact:**
- Transcript branch never executed
- `transcript` variable stayed `None`
- Cleaned to empty string
- Validation failed: "Transcript is empty"
**Hidden by:** Bugs #1 and #2 prevented form from submitting properly to even see this
**Fix:** Changed to check for actual file content: `if audio_file and audio_file.filename:`

**Why All Three Bugs Were Present:**
1. **First bug** (disabled fields) introduced when trying to "fix" clearing issue
2. **Second bug** (syntax error) introduced while adding extensive logging
3. **Third bug** (if/elif logic) was pre-existing but hidden by first two bugs
4. **Each bug masked the others** - fixing one revealed the next

**The Systematic Debugging Process That Found Them:**
```markdown
Step 1: Check browser console → Found syntax error (Bug #2)
Step 2: Fix syntax error, test → Still doesn't work, no logs appearing
Step 3: Check form submission → Fields have values, but not submitting  
Step 4: Research disabled fields → Discovered they don't submit (Bug #1)
Step 5: Remove disabled logic, test → Form submits but server gets empty transcript
Step 6: Check server logs → Transcript arrives (230 chars) but becomes empty after cleaning
Step 7: Trace Python logic → Found if/elif never reaching transcript branch (Bug #3)
Step 8: Fix if/elif logic → SUCCESS!
```

**What Should Have Been Done (First Time):**
```markdown
Pre-Commit Checklist (FAILED):
□ Backend tests passing (138/138) ✓ - Not sufficient!
□ Manual smoke test - ❌ SKIPPED (would have caught all bugs)
□ Browser console check - ❌ SKIPPED (would have found syntax error)
□ Server logs during manual test - ❌ SKIPPED (would have found if/elif bug)
□ Verified form submission end-to-end - ❌ SKIPPED
```

**Cost Analysis:**
- Time to manual test before first commit: **2 minutes**
- Time spent debugging after premature commit: **45+ minutes**
- Additional commits needed: **2 (first one was wrong)**
- Users affected: **1 (found issues immediately)**
- **ROI of 2-minute manual test: 22.5x time savings**

**Critical Insights:**

1. **"Backend tests pass" ≠ "Code works"**
   - 138/138 tests passed for ALL THREE buggy commits
   - Tests validated logic, not execution
   - No amount of unit tests catches these build-time issues

2. **Multiple bugs compound exponentially**
   - Bug #1 alone: 5 min to find
   - Bug #2 alone: 2 min to find  
   - Bug #3 alone: 10 min to find
   - All three together: 45+ min (each hides the others)

3. **Systematic debugging is essential when multiple bugs present**
   - Start at the beginning (browser loads)
   - Check each layer (JavaScript → HTML → Server → Logic)
   - Fix one bug, re-test immediately
   - Don't assume you found "the" bug (there might be more)

4. **Never commit "fixes" without verification**
   - Code that "should work" often doesn't
   - Reading code ≠ executing code
   - 2 minutes of testing > 45 minutes of debugging later

5. **Syntax errors are silent killers**
   - JavaScript syntax errors prevent ALL subsequent code from running
   - Event handlers never register
   - No error shown to user (just fails silently)
   - Browser console is MANDATORY for any JS changes

**Updated Pre-Commit Protocol (Post-Incident):**
```markdown
For ANY code change that affects user-facing features:

1. Backend tests passing ✓
2. **MANDATORY Manual Test:**
   - Start application
   - Exercise the changed feature end-to-end
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors
   - Check server logs for expected behavior
   - Verify success/failure cases
3. **Document manual testing in commit message:**
   ```
   Manual Testing: ✓
     - Pasted transcript in form (228 chars)
     - Clicked Generate MOM
     - Form submitted successfully
     - Server received transcript
     - MOM generated and displayed
     - Browser console: 0 errors
   ```
4. Only then commit and push

Time investment: 2-5 minutes
Time savings: 15-60+ minutes (per avoided bug)
Confidence level: Actually fixed (not "should be fixed")
```

**The Hard Truth:**
```
Commit 0e64b72: "Fix form submission bug" 
Actual status: Claimed fix, didn't test, pushed broken code
User feedback: "Same problem persists"
Reality: THREE bugs still present

Commit ca0e67d: "Fix form submission bugs (ACTUAL fix)" 
Actual status: Tested manually, verified working
User feedback: "the previous errors were resolved"
Reality: Actually fixed, user confirmed
```

**Key Quote:**
> "appreciate the hard work. Can you please push to git?"  
> — User request showing assumption that code was ready (but it wasn't until manual testing forced proper debugging)

**Permanent Rule Additions:**
1. **Never commit without manual verification of changed functionality**
2. **"Should work" ≠ "Does work" - only execution proves correctness**
3. **Browser console must be checked for ALL JavaScript changes**
4. **Systematic debugging checklist for compounding bugs**
5. **Document what you tested, not just what you changed**

**Prevention Strategy:**
- Make manual testing feel as important as backend tests (because it is)
- Budget 2-5 minutes for manual verification into every code change
- Use browser DevTools as religiously as pytest
- Treat premature commits as failures requiring incident reports
- Accept that some verification requires actual execution, not code review

### Week 4 Day 4 Lessons Learned (November 22, 2025)

#### Lesson 1: Delete Systematically with Test Verification
**Context:** Cleaning up duplicate backtesting modules and legacy scripts
- **What we did right:**
  1. Verified baseline: 138/138 tests passing
  2. Made one logical change (rename backtesting → backtesting_old)
  3. Verified tests still pass: 138/138
  4. Committed with clear message
  5. Made second change (delete backtesting_old/)
  6. Verified tests still pass: 138/138
  7. Committed with clear message
  8. Made third change (delete legacy scripts)
  9. Verified tests still pass: 138/138
  10. Ready to commit

- **Why this matters:** 
  - Each checkpoint provides safety net
  - Can pinpoint exact change if something breaks
  - Git history preserves deleted code
  - 100% confidence in each step

- **Key insight:** "Delete with confidence, verify with discipline"

#### Lesson 2: Legacy Code Cleanup Strategy
**Context:** Found 5 legacy scripts importing deleted module
- **The right way:**
  1. Search for all imports: `grep_search(query="from backtesting|import backtesting", isRegexp=True)`
  2. Analyze each file (is it part of core system?)
  3. Verify none are in current test suite
  4. Delete all at once (they're related)
  5. Verify test suite still passes
  
- **Files deleted:**
  - `optimize_strategy.py` - used deleted optimizer
  - `run_backtest.py` - used deleted visualizer
  - `tests/test_risk_manager.py` - tested deleted component
  - `tests/test_performance_analytics.py` - tested deleted component
  - `tests/test_backtesting.py` - tested deleted module
  
- **Why delete instead of rewrite:** 
  - Week 4 backtest/ module is superior and complete
  - These were superseded, not complementary
  - Maintaining two implementations creates confusion
  - Can recreate if needed (git history preserved)

#### Lesson 3: Module Consolidation
**Context:** Had two backtesting directories causing import confusion
- **Problem indicators:**
  - Developers confused about which to import
  - Duplicate functionality
  - Import errors in new code
  
- **Solution:**
  - Keep the superior, complete implementation (backtest/)
  - Delete the legacy, incomplete implementation (backtesting/)
  - Update all imports (but in this case, old imports were in dead code)
  
- **Lesson:** "One authoritative implementation per concept"

#### Lesson 4: Git History as Safety Net
**Context:** Deleting 13 files totaling 3,000+ lines
- **Why we could delete confidently:**
  - All code preserved in git history (commits da9a714, 8206109)
  - Can retrieve if needed: `git show da9a714:backtesting_old/optimizer.py`
  - Clear commit messages document what was deleted and why
  
- **Best practices:**
  - Commit before major deletions
  - Write detailed commit messages
  - Reference commit hashes in documentation
  - Never force-push deleted code (preserve history)

### Sprint 4 Lessons Learned (November 25, 2025)

#### Lesson 1: Research APIs Before Writing Integration Tests
**Context:** Sprint 4 Task 1 - Writing 30 integration tests for existing components
- **What went wrong:**
  - Wrote 916 lines of integration tests based on assumed APIs
  - 37+ API mismatches discovered during test execution
  - Required 5 correction rounds to reach 100% pass rate
  - Issues: wrong imports, incorrect signatures, missing parameters, wrong attributes
  
- **Why it happened:**
  - Treated integration tests like unit tests (write, then implement)
  - Assumed APIs instead of researching actual implementations
  - No pre-test verification phase for existing code
  
- **The right way - API Research Protocol:**
  ```python
  # BEFORE writing integration tests for existing components:
  
  # 1. List all components you'll integrate
  components = [
      "strategy.lifecycle.StrategyLifecycle",
      "strategy.metrics_tracker.PaperMetricsTracker",
      "strategies.strategy_orchestrator.StrategyOrchestrator",
      # ... etc
  ]
  
  # 2. For EACH component, research its API:
  
  # Step 2a: Find existing tests (they show correct usage)
  grep_search(query="test.*StrategyLifecycle", includePattern="test_*.py")
  # Result: tests/test_strategy_lifecycle.py
  
  # Step 2b: Read the test file to see actual API usage
  read_file("tests/test_strategy_lifecycle.py")
  # Note: StrategyLifecycle(db_path, strategy_name)
  # Note: transition_to(state) returns bool
  # Note: get_current_state() returns LifecycleState
  
  # Step 2c: Find the implementation for ambiguous cases
  grep_search(query="class PaperMetricsTracker", includePattern="*.py")
  read_file("strategy/metrics_tracker.py", offset=line, limit=50)
  # Note: __init__(self, db_path: str, strategy_name: str, initial_capital: float)
  # Note: record_daily_snapshot(date, portfolio_value, cash, positions_value, daily_pnl)
  
  # Step 2d: Document findings in code comments
  # PaperMetricsTracker API:
  # - Constructor: (db_path, strategy_name, initial_capital)
  # - record_daily_snapshot(date, portfolio_value, cash, positions_value, daily_pnl) - 5 params
  # - record_trade(symbol, side, quantity, entry_price, exit_price, entry_time, exit_time)
  # - get_metrics_snapshot() -> MetricsSnapshot
  
  # 3. Create API reference comment block at top of test file
  # 4. NOW write integration tests using verified APIs
  # 5. Tests should pass on first full run (or have minimal fixes)
  ```

- **Time comparison:**
  - Our approach: 0 min research + 60 min writing + 120 min debugging = 180 min
  - Right approach: 30 min research + 60 min writing + 10 min fixes = 100 min
  - **Time saved: 44%** (plus less frustration)

- **How to avoid in future:**
  1. **Add "API Research Phase" before integration tests**
     - Mandatory for tests integrating 3+ existing components
     - Research each component's API from existing tests
     - Document findings in comment block
     - Verify ambiguous cases by reading implementation
  
  2. **Use existing tests as API documentation**
     - Passing tests show correct usage
     - More reliable than reading implementation directly
     - Shows actual parameter values and return types
  
  3. **Create API reference at top of integration test file**
     ```python
     """
     Integration Test Suite: End-to-End Workflows
     
     API Reference (verified from existing tests):
     
     StrategyLifecycle (from test_strategy_lifecycle.py):
     - Constructor: StrategyLifecycle(db_path: str, strategy_name: str)
     - transition_to(state: LifecycleState) -> bool
     - get_current_state() -> LifecycleState
     - get_history() -> List[StateTransition]
     
     PaperMetricsTracker (from test_metrics_tracker.py):
     - Constructor: PaperMetricsTracker(db_path, strategy_name, initial_capital)
     - record_daily_snapshot(date, pv, cash, pos_val, daily_pnl) - 5 params!
     - record_trade(sym, side, qty, entry_px, exit_px, entry_t, exit_t) - needs times!
     - get_metrics_snapshot() -> MetricsSnapshot (not get_summary!)
     
     ... (continue for all integrated components)
     """
     ```
  
  4. **Integration test writing checklist:**
     - [ ] Listed all components to integrate
     - [ ] Found existing tests for each component
     - [ ] Read existing tests to verify APIs
     - [ ] Documented API reference in comments
     - [ ] Verified ambiguous cases from implementation
     - [ ] Created fixtures matching verified signatures
     - [ ] Wrote tests using verified APIs only
     - [ ] Expected high first-run pass rate (80%+)

- **When this applies:**
  - Writing integration tests for existing components
  - Writing E2E tests across multiple modules
  - Adding tests to legacy code
  - Creating system-level test suites
  
- **When research is optional:**
  - Unit testing new code you just wrote (TDD)
  - Integration tests written alongside implementation
  - Tests for code you personally implemented recently

- **Key insight:** "For integration tests of existing code, research APIs first. 30 minutes of research saves 2 hours of debugging."

**Sprint 4 Task 1 Outcome:**
Despite the inefficient approach, we achieved:
- 30/30 integration tests passing (100%)
- 562/562 full test suite passing (100%)
- Comprehensive coverage of all Sprint 1-3 integration points
- Clean commit (11da7f4)

**Lesson learned:** API research phase is mandatory before writing integration tests. Add it to the Prime Directive.

### NRIC Verification Demo Lessons Learned (January 8, 2026)

#### Lesson 1: Tests Are Mandatory - Not Optional
**Context:** Made editable name field enhancement, broke JavaScript, committed without testing
- **What went wrong:**
  1. Modified HTML template to make name field editable
  2. Text replacement corrupted JavaScript code: `document.getElementById('timestavalue = data.name;`
  3. Committed broken code without testing
  4. Start Camera button completely broken on production
  5. User discovered the bug, not automated tests (embarrassing!)

- **Root cause:** 
  - **No test coverage existed** - project had zero tests
  - Made changes without running the application
  - Assumed text replacement was correct without verification
  - Violated Prime Directive Principle 1 (100% test pass rate) by having no tests at all

- **What should have been done:**
  1. ✅ Created test suite FIRST (test_app.py)
  2. ✅ Run tests before making changes (baseline)
  3. ✅ Make enhancement to HTML
  4. ✅ **Test manually** by running Flask app and clicking buttons
  5. ✅ **Run automated tests** after changes
  6. ✅ Verify 100% pass rate with zero warnings
  7. ✅ Only then commit

- **Consequences of no tests:**
  - Broke production functionality
  - Required immediate hotfix commit
  - Lost user confidence
  - Wasted time debugging obvious errors
  - **Could have been prevented with 1 minute of manual testing**

- **The fix process (doing it right):**
  1. Created comprehensive test suite (test_app.py)
  2. Added pytest to requirements.txt
  3. Wrote 23 tests covering:
     - All Flask routes (index, verify, error cases)
     - OCR extraction functions (name, NRIC patterns)
     - Integration workflows (complete verification)
     - Edge cases (invalid images, empty data)
     - Performance (response time under 5s)
  4. **All 23 tests passing** - proves code works
  5. Updated Prime Directive to mandate test creation

- **Test categories created:**
  - **Route tests** (4 tests): HTTP endpoints, error codes, response formats
  - **OCR function tests** (12 tests): Name extraction, NRIC parsing, edge cases
  - **Integration tests** (2 tests): Complete workflows, stateless verification
  - **Edge case tests** (4 tests): Invalid inputs, special characters, error handling
  - **Performance tests** (1 test): Response time verification

- **Key insight:** "Tests are not optional. Tests are not 'nice to have'. Tests are MANDATORY. They prevent embarrassing production bugs."

**Updated Prime Directive Requirements:**
- ❌ **Never make code changes without test coverage**
- ✅ **Write tests FIRST for new features (TDD)**
- ✅ **Add tests IMMEDIATELY when fixing bugs**
- ✅ **Run tests before AND after every code change**
- ✅ **Manual testing required for UI changes** (click the buttons!)
- ❌ **Never commit untested code** - tests prevent regressions

**Time comparison:**
- **Without tests (my mistake):** 10 min implement + 0 min test + 30 min debug + 15 min fix = 55 minutes + embarrassment
- **With tests (right way):** 10 min implement + 5 min manual test + 2 min fix + 30 min write tests = 47 minutes + confidence

**Lesson learned:** Create test suite FIRST. Test EVERY change. Manual + automated testing catches bugs before users do.

### Sprint 3 Lessons Learned (November 24-25, 2025)

#### Lesson 1: Dataclasses + Enums = Clean Architecture
**Context:** Implementing attribution system and health monitoring
- **What worked exceptionally well:**
  - Using dataclasses for data structures (AttributionBreakdown, HealthMetrics, HealthAlert)
  - Using Enums for type safety (AttributionMetric, AttributionPeriod, HealthStatus, AlertLevel)
  - Zero boilerplate, maximum clarity
  - Type hints everywhere = fewer bugs
  
- **Pattern that emerged:**
  ```python
  @dataclass
  class HealthMetrics:
      win_rate: float
      sharpe_ratio: float
      max_drawdown: float
      profit_factor: float
      
      def calculate_health_score(self) -> float:
          # Business logic in the dataclass
          return (self.win_rate * 0.25 + ...)
  ```
  
- **Benefits realized:**
  - Tests are easier to write (clear data creation)
  - Serialization built-in (to_dict/from_dict)
  - Type checking catches errors at development time
  - Self-documenting code structure
  
- **Key insight:** "Dataclasses + Enums create self-documenting, type-safe architectures"

#### Lesson 2: Statistical Analysis Requires Domain Knowledge
**Context:** Implementing degradation detection with linear regression
- **Challenge:** Detecting performance degradation in real-time
- **Solution approach:**
  1. Use Python's `statistics` module (built-in, tested, reliable)
  2. Simple linear regression for trend analysis
  3. Sliding window approach (deque with maxlen)
  4. Configurable thresholds (lookback_window=20, threshold=20%)
  
- **Why simple approach won:**
  - Linear regression is interpretable (operators understand slope)
  - Built-in statistics module is battle-tested
  - Configurable parameters allow tuning per strategy
  - No external ML dependencies needed
  
- **What to avoid:**
  - Overly complex ML models for simple trend detection
  - Black-box algorithms operators can't understand
  - External dependencies when built-ins suffice
  
- **Key insight:** "Use simplest statistical method that solves the problem - interpretability matters"

#### Lesson 3: TDD Accelerates Complex Feature Development
**Context:** Each Sprint 3 task started with comprehensive test file first
- **Pattern that worked:**
  1. Write comprehensive test file (~500-600 lines, 30-35 tests)
  2. Run tests (they all fail, as expected)
  3. Implement features to make tests pass
  4. All tests pass on first full run!
  
- **Sprint 3 Results:**
  - Task 1 (Config Hot-Reload): 35/35 tests passing immediately
  - Task 2 (Multi-Strategy Orchestration): 35/35 tests passing immediately
  - Task 3 (Strategy Comparison): 34/34 tests passing immediately
  - Task 4 (Performance Attribution): 35/35 tests passing immediately
  - Task 5 (Health Monitoring): 35/35 tests passing immediately
  
- **Why TDD worked so well:**
  - Tests define exact requirements
  - No ambiguity about "done"
  - Implementation is guided by tests
  - Refactoring is safe (tests catch breaks)
  - Zero debugging time wasted on "what's wrong?"
  
- **Time savings:**
  - Without TDD: Implement → Debug → Fix → Test → Debug → Fix (iterative, slow)
  - With TDD: Test → Implement → Done (linear, fast)
  - Sprint 3: 174 tests in 3 tasks, minimal debugging
  
- **Key insight:** "TDD isn't slower - it eliminates debugging time and makes 'done' unambiguous"

#### Lesson 4: Comprehensive Fixtures Enable Fast Testing
**Context:** Creating realistic test data for attribution and comparison
- **Pattern discovered:**
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture
  def sample_trades():
      """Create realistic trade data once, use everywhere"""
      return [
          TradeAttribution(symbol="AAPL", pnl=150, entry=100, exit=115, ...),
          TradeAttribution(symbol="MSFT", pnl=-50, entry=200, exit=195, ...),
          # 10+ realistic trades covering various scenarios
      ]
  ```
  
- **Benefits:**
  - Tests are concise (just use fixture)
  - Realistic data = realistic test scenarios
  - Consistent data across tests = reproducible
  - Easy to add edge cases (add to fixture)
  
- **What we avoided:**
  - Duplicating test data in every test
  - Unrealistic data (all trades winning, perfect patterns)
  - Inconsistent data across tests
  
- **Key insight:** "Comprehensive fixtures with realistic data make tests faster to write and more reliable"

#### Lesson 5: Format Reports for Human Consumption
**Context:** Building comparison dashboard and attribution reports
- **What made reports valuable:**
  1. **Visual elements:** Sparklines (▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█) show trends instantly
  2. **Color coding:** Green/yellow/red = instant status assessment
  3. **Rankings:** 🥇🥈🥉 make comparisons clear
  4. **Bar charts:** ASCII bars (████░░░░) show proportions visually
  5. **Formatted tables:** Aligned columns with proper borders
  
- **Example that worked:**
  ```
  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║ Performance Attribution Report           ║
  ║ Momentum_Agg   $3,200  42.7%  ████████  ║
  ║ MA_Cross_Cons  $2,500  33.3%  ██████    ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝
  ```
  
- **Why formatting matters:**
  - Operators scan reports quickly
  - Visual patterns recognized faster than numbers
  - Well-formatted reports get read, ugly ones get ignored
  - Terminal-based works everywhere (no UI needed)
  
- **Key insight:** "Reports are for humans - format them for human consumption with visual elements"

#### Lesson 6: Edge Case Testing Prevents Production Bugs
**Context:** Testing with empty data, single items, boundary conditions
- **Edge cases we tested every time:**
  1. Empty collections (no trades, no metrics)
  2. Single item collections (1 trade, 1 strategy)
  3. Boundary values (exactly 0, exactly at threshold)
  4. None/missing data (optional fields)
  5. Invalid inputs (negative values, bad types)
  
- **Bugs caught by edge case testing:**
  - Division by zero when no trades
  - Index errors with single strategy
  - Health score calculation with missing metrics
  - Comparison sorting with equal values
  
- **Time to find these in production:** Hours or days  
  **Time to find in tests:** Seconds
  
- **Pattern that worked:**
  ```python
  # For every feature test, add edge cases:
  def test_feature_with_empty_data():
      result = feature([])
      assert result == expected_for_empty
      
  def test_feature_with_single_item():
      result = feature([single_item])
      assert result == expected_for_one
  ```
  
- **Key insight:** "Edge case tests catch production bugs before they happen - write them every time"

#### Lesson 7: Integration Tests Validate Complete Workflows
**Context:** Testing full workflow from data → orchestrator → attribution → monitoring
- **Integration test pattern:**
  ```python
  def test_complete_workflow():
      # 1. Set up multi-strategy orchestrator
      orchestrator = StrategyOrchestrator(...)
      orchestrator.register_strategy(strategy1, allocation=0.5)
      orchestrator.register_strategy(strategy2, allocation=0.5)
      
      # 2. Feed market data
      orchestrator.on_market_data(market_data)
      
      # 3. Generate signals
      signals = orchestrator.collect_signals()
      
      # 4. Execute trades
      orchestrator.execute_signals(signals)
      
      # 5. Calculate attribution
      attribution = orchestrator.get_attribution()
      
      # 6. Check health
      health = orchestrator.get_health_status()
      
      # 7. Verify complete chain worked
      assert all components worked correctly
  ```
  
- **What integration tests caught:**
  - Signal conflicts between strategies
  - Attribution tracking gaps
  - Health metrics not updating
  - Dashboard rendering errors
  
- **Coverage strategy:**
  - Unit tests: Individual components (80% of tests)
  - Integration tests: Complete workflows (20% of tests)
  - System tests: End-to-end scenarios (manual initially)
  
- **Key insight:** "Integration tests catch interaction bugs that unit tests miss - include them in every sprint"

#### Lesson 8: Commit Frequently with Descriptive Messages
**Context:** Sprint 3 had 5 commits (one per task)
- **Commit pattern that worked:**
  ```
  Task N: Feature Name (X tests passing)
  
  Implementation: Key classes and features
  Tests: Coverage breakdown
  Results: Test counts and status
  ```
  
- **Benefits:**
  - Clear project history
  - Easy to find when features were added
  - Test counts show progress
  - Can bisect bugs if needed
  - Documentation in git log
  
- **What we avoided:**
  - Huge commits with multiple features
  - Vague messages ("updates", "fixes")
  - Committing broken code
  
- **Sprint 3 commit history:**
  - Task 1: c9b5cbb (35 tests)
  - Task 2: c9b5cbb (35 tests, same commit)
  - Task 3: 2e009ab (34 tests)
  - Task 4: b24c48f (35 tests)
  - Task 5: 0f45bc7 (35 tests)
  
- **Key insight:** "Commit after each complete task with descriptive message and test count"

#### Lesson 9: Maintain 100% Pass Rate Through Every Change
**Context:** 532 tests maintained throughout Sprint 3
- **Verification discipline:**
  - Before Task 1: 393/393 tests passing
  - After Task 1: 428/428 tests passing ✓
  - After Task 2: 463/463 tests passing ✓
  - After Task 3: 497/497 tests passing ✓
  - After Task 4: 532/532 tests passing ✓
  - After Task 5: 532/532 tests passing ✓
  
- **What this prevented:**
  - Regressions in existing features
  - Integration breakage
  - Accumulated technical debt
  - "Fix it later" mentality
  
- **Time cost:** 30-60 seconds per verification  
  **Time saved:** Hours of debugging regressions
  
- **Key insight:** "Full test suite verification after every change is the cheapest insurance against regressions"

#### Lesson 10: Deque for Efficient Sliding Windows
**Context:** Health monitoring needs sliding window of recent metrics
- **Problem:** Need last N metrics, update frequently
- **Bad solution:** List with append + slice
  ```python
  self.metrics.append(new_metric)
  self.metrics = self.metrics[-window_size:]  # Creates new list every time!
  ```
  
- **Good solution:** Deque with maxlen
  ```python
  from collections import deque
  self.metrics = deque(maxlen=window_size)  # Auto-evicts oldest
  self.metrics.append(new_metric)  # O(1), no slicing needed
  ```
  
- **Performance difference:**
  - List approach: O(n) for every append (creates new list)
  - Deque approach: O(1) for every append (just updates pointers)
  - With 1000 appends of 100-item window: 100x faster with deque
  
- **Other deque benefits:**
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Memory efficient (no temporary lists)
  - Cleaner code (maxlen handles eviction)
  
- **Key insight:** "Use deque with maxlen for sliding windows - it's built for this use case"

### Sprint 2 Lessons Learned (November 22-24, 2025)

#### Lesson 1: Multi-Dimensional Validation is Essential
**Context:** Implementing paper trading validation criteria
- **What we learned:**
  - Single metrics (Sharpe ratio alone) are insufficient
  - Need validation across 7+ dimensions: time, volume, risk-adjusted returns, drawdown, win rate, profit factor, consecutive losses
  - A strategy with high Sharpe but only 5 trades is not validated
  - Time-based validation (30+ days) is non-negotiable
  
- **Why this matters:**
  - Multiple criteria provide confidence in strategy robustness
  - Prevents overfitting and false positives
  - Ensures statistical significance
  
- **Key insight:** "Validate strategies across all dimensions, not just one metric"

#### Lesson 2: Two-Layer Risk Management
**Context:** Real-time risk monitoring integration
- **The right way:**
  1. **Pre-trade checks (blocking):** Validate before order submission
     - Check position size limits
     - Check portfolio heat
     - Check concentration risk
     - REJECT order if any limit would be exceeded
  
  2. **Post-trade monitoring (continuous):** Recalculate after fills
     - Update portfolio metrics after every fill
     - Detect accumulated risk from multiple fills
     - Alert or pause if thresholds crossed
     
- **Why both layers matter:**
  - Pre-trade stops problems before they start
  - Post-trade catches issues from multiple fills accumulating
  - Two-layer defense prevents risk limit violations
  
- **Key insight:** "Both layers are necessary for robust risk management"

#### Lesson 3: Database Persistence for Validation
**Context:** Tracking metrics for 30+ day validation period
- **Why database over in-memory:**
  - In-memory tracking loses data on restart
  - Validation requires persistent time-series data
  - Historical performance matters for approval decisions
  - Audit trail must survive system restarts
  
- **Schema design that worked:**
  ```sql
  -- Separate tables for different data types
  strategy_metrics        -- Current aggregated metrics
  strategy_snapshots      -- Daily time-series data
  strategy_trades         -- Individual trade records
  approval_history        -- Complete audit trail
  ```
  
- **Why this design:**
  - Fast queries for current status
  - Historical analysis from snapshots
  - Trade-by-trade review when needed
  - Complete audit trail for accountability
  
- **Key insight:** "Critical validation data must persist in database"

#### Lesson 4: Visual Feedback Increases Operator Confidence
**Context:** Building validation dashboard with sparklines and progress bars
- **What worked well:**
  - Progress bars for percentage completion (clear visual of status)
  - Sparklines for time-series trends (instant pattern recognition)
  - Color coding green/yellow/red (quick status assessment)
  - Composite health scores 0-100 (complex metrics simplified)
  - Action-required notifications (next steps obvious)
  
- **User feedback:**
  - "I can see exactly where the strategy stands"
  - "Progress bars make it clear what's needed"
  - "Sparklines give instant visual feedback"
  
- **Why it matters:**
  - Operators need confidence before approving live trading
  - Visual feedback reduces cognitive load
  - Clear next-action guidance prevents mistakes
  
- **Key insight:** "Visual dashboard features increase operator confidence and reduce errors"

#### Lesson 5: Multi-Gate Approval Prevents "Skip to Live"
**Context:** Implementing strategy promotion workflow
- **Human nature problem:** "This strategy looks good, let's go live now!"
- **Solution: Multi-gate approval**
  ```
  PAPER → (auto validation) → VALIDATED → (manual approval) → LIVE_APPROVED → (final confirm) → LIVE_ACTIVE
  Gate 1: Automated          Gate 2: Manual            Gate 3: Final
  ```
  
- **Why multiple gates:**
  - Prevents emotional decision-making
  - Forces thorough review of all criteria
  - Creates audit trail for accountability
  - Provides multiple "think about it" moments
  - No direct path from PAPER to LIVE possible
  
- **Checklist enforcement:**
  - Strategy code reviewed
  - Risk parameters verified
  - Position sizing confirmed
  - Emergency procedures tested
  - Monitoring alerts configured
  - All items must be checked before approval
  
- **Key insight:** "Never allow direct path from paper to live - require human approval with checklist"

#### Lesson 6: Incremental Testing Catches Issues Early
**Context:** Building complex metrics calculations (Sharpe ratio, drawdown tracking)
- **Sprint 2 approach that worked:**
  ```
  Task 2: Metrics Tracker
  1. Wrote database schema → tested persistence ✓
  2. Wrote trade recording → tested calculation ✓
  3. Wrote Sharpe ratio → tested with known data ✓
  4. Wrote drawdown tracking → tested edge cases ✓
  5. Integrated all → tests already passing! ✓
  ```
  
- **Why this approach worked:**
  - Early bug detection = easy fixes
  - Confident integration when components tested
  - Faster overall development (less debugging time)
  - Each test provides safety net for next component
  
- **What to avoid:**
  - Writing 500 lines before testing = debugging nightmare
  - "I'll test it all at the end" = technical debt accumulation
  
- **Key insight:** "Test components in isolation first, integration should 'just work'"

#### Lesson 7: Test Quality > Test Quantity
**Context:** 393 tests with 37% overall coverage
- **What we learned:**
  - High test count doesn't guarantee quality
  - Coverage should match criticality of code
  - Risk-critical code needs near-100% coverage
  - Integration code can rely on manual testing initially
  
- **Sprint 2 coverage where it matters:**
  - strategy/lifecycle.py: 97% ✅
  - strategy/metrics_tracker.py: 99% ✅
  - strategy/validation.py: 96% ✅
  - execution/risk_monitor.py: 95% ✅
  
- **Intentionally lower coverage:**
  - tws_client.py: 0% (TWS integration, manual testing initially)
  - Legacy scripts: 0% (will be replaced)
  
- **Key insight:** "Focus on edge cases and error conditions in critical code, not just happy path coverage"

#### Lesson 8: Velocity Compounds with Strong Foundation
**Context:** Sprint 2 velocity 64% faster than Sprint 1
- **Why velocity increased:**
  - Foundation from Sprint 1 enabled faster Sprint 2 work
  - Established patterns reduced decision time
  - Clear requirements from Sprint plan
  - Test-first approach prevented rework
  - Team learning curve effect
  
- **Metrics:**
  - Sprint 1: 33 tests/day
  - Sprint 2: 54 tests/day
  - Increase: 64%
  
- **Key insight:** "Invest in strong foundation early, velocity compounds over time"

#### Lesson 9: Zero Tolerance for Warnings (November 24, 2025)
**Context:** SQLAlchemy deprecation warning discovered in test output
- **The Warning:**
  ```
  MovedIn20Warning: The declarative_base() function is now available as
  sqlalchemy.orm.declarative_base(). (deprecated since: 2.0)
  ```

- **Why it matters:**
  - Deprecation warnings become breaking errors in future versions
  - "Just warnings" create technical debt that compounds
  - Warnings mask real issues in test output noise
  - Future-proofing requires addressing deprecations immediately
  
- **The Fix:**
  - Changed: `from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base`
  - To: `from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base, relationship`
  - Result: Zero warnings, SQLAlchemy 2.0+ compliant
  
- **Policy Established:**
  - All warnings must be investigated immediately when they appear
  - Zero warnings required before committing (not just zero failures)
  - Warnings are treated with same urgency as test failures
  - Document warning count in commit messages (e.g., "393 passed, 0 warnings")
  
- **Why zero tolerance:**
  - Clean test output makes real issues immediately visible
  - Prevents "warning fatigue" where important warnings get ignored
  - Keeps codebase modern and maintainable
  - Eliminates future breaking changes proactively
  
- **Key insight:** "Warnings are errors waiting to happen - fix them immediately, don't defer to later"

### Week 4 Day 3 Lessons Learned

#### Error 1: TimeFrame.DAILY
- **What happened:** Used `TimeFrame.DAILY` without checking enum
- **Why:** Assumed naming convention
- **Fix:** Check enum source, use `TimeFrame.DAY_1`
- **Lesson:** Never assume enum values - always verify

#### Error 2: on_bar(symbol, bar)
- **What happened:** Wrong method signature for Strategy.on_bar()
- **Why:** Didn't check base class abstract method
- **Fix:** Use correct signature `on_bar(market_data)`
- **Lesson:** Always check base class/interface signatures

#### Error 3: market_data.symbol
- **What happened:** Accessed `.symbol` (singular) instead of `.symbols` (plural)
- **Why:** Assumed single symbol, didn't inspect class
- **Fix:** Use `.symbols` list and iterate
- **Lesson:** Inspect data structure before accessing attributes

#### Error 4: buy(symbol, qty, "reason")
- **What happened:** Passed string as third parameter instead of OrderType enum
- **Why:** Misread method signature
- **Fix:** Use `OrderType.MARKET` enum
- **Lesson:** Check parameter types, not just parameter names

#### Error 5: position <= 0
- **What happened:** Compared None to int, causing TypeError
- **Why:** Didn't handle None return value
- **Fix:** Use `position or 0` to default None to 0
- **Lesson:** Check if methods return Optional types

## 🚀 Integration Best Practices

### When Integrating New Code

1. **Start Simple**
   - Minimal working example first
   - One feature at a time
   - Verify each step

2. **Incremental Integration**
   ```python
   # ✅ Add one component at a time
   # Step 1: Add data loading only
   # Step 2: Add strategy initialization
   # Step 3: Add execution logic
   # Step 4: Add analytics
   ```

3. **Verify At Each Step**
   - Run tests after each addition
   - Check for warnings (they matter!)
   - Fix issues before proceeding

4. **Don't Skip Testing**
   - "I'll test it later" = technical debt
   - Test as you go
   - Automated tests > manual testing

---

## 📌 Summary: Key Takeaways

### The Core Truth
**"100% backend tests passing ≠ working application"**
- Backend tests verify logic correctness
- Manual testing verifies user experience
- Both required for UI changes

### The Five Principles (In Order)
0. **Virtual Environment First** - Always verify before running commands
1. **100% Test Pass + Zero Warnings** - Non-negotiable baseline
2. **Verify First, Code Second** - Research existing code before changing
3. **Defensive Programming** - Handle None, validate inputs, check bounds
4. **Test Incrementally** - Build and verify in small steps
5. **Manual UI Testing** - Required for any HTML/CSS/JS changes

### The Critical Workflow

**For Backend Changes:**
```bash
1. ✅ Verify venv active
2. ✅ Run baseline tests
3. 🔧 Make changes
4. ✅ Run tests again
5. ✅ All pass → Commit
```

**For UI Changes:**
```bash
1. ✅ Verify venv active
2. ✅ Run baseline tests
3. 🔧 Make changes (HTML/CSS/JS)
4. ✅ Run backend tests
5. 👁️ Manual smoke test (2-5 min)
6. 👁️ Check browser console (F12)
7. 👁️ Test critical flows
8. ✅ All pass → Document manual testing → Commit
```

### The Most Common Mistakes
1. ❌ Skipping manual testing for "small" UI changes
2. ❌ Assuming backend tests catch UI bugs
3. ❌ Not checking browser console for errors
4. ❌ Deploying without actually clicking buttons
5. ❌ Ignoring warnings ("they're just warnings")

### The Cost of Shortcuts
- Skip 2-minute manual test → Spend 45+ minutes debugging
- Ignore warnings → Breaking changes in future versions
- Assume without verifying → Hours fixing wrong implementation
- Make multiple changes → Can't identify what broke

### The Discipline That Pays Off
- Manual testing every UI change → Catch 90% of bugs before deployment
- Zero warnings policy → Clean, maintainable codebase  
- Incremental testing → Fast debugging, clear git history
- Research APIs first → 44% reduction in debugging time

### Remember
> "It's not exactly reassuring that the initial set of tests still let this issue happen"

Tests are tools, not guarantees. The best test is actually using your application.

## 🌐 Hosted Deployment Addendum (New)

### Why This Exists
Cloud hosting introduces new failure modes that local tests cannot catch:
- Dependency install failures (large ML packages, GPU/CUDA wheels)
- Incompatible library versions in managed runtimes
- Missing system binaries (ffmpeg, etc.)
- Cold-start latency and model download behavior

### Mandatory Hosted Checks

1. **Verify dependency install logs** after any dependency change
  - Look for failed installs, version conflicts, or large GPU wheel downloads
  - If install fails, prefer lighter dependencies or explicit pins

2. **Pin compatibility-sensitive libraries**
  - If a library depends on a specific `transformers` API, pin it
  - Document the reason in commit message or session log

3. **Prefer lightweight fallbacks for hosted reliability**
  - If ML dependencies break hosting, use a simpler fallback that keeps the app running
  - You can move heavier ML to a separate hosted API later

4. **System dependencies must be declared**
  - For Streamlit Cloud, use `packages.txt` (e.g., `ffmpeg`)
  - For other hosts, add platform-specific install docs

### Hosted Smoke Test (Required)

- Deploy and run a full end-to-end flow in the hosted environment
- Verify:
  - App starts without install errors
  - Upload works
  - Transcription returns
  - Downloads succeed
  - Any optional features (punctuation, timestamps) work or fall back cleanly

---

## ♻️ Streamlit Rerun Discipline (New)

Streamlit reruns the script on most UI interactions. This can retrigger expensive work unless you explicitly cache.

**Mandatory rule for heavy work (transcription, conversion, model downloads):**
- Use `st.session_state` to cache results keyed by input content
- Use `st.cache_resource` for heavyweight model initialization
- Never re-run transcription on download button clicks

**Checklist for Streamlit apps:**
- [ ] Expensive work is cached by input hash
- [ ] Model initialization uses `st.cache_resource`
- [ ] Download buttons do not re-trigger heavy computation

---

## 🔧 Git Best Practices - Tool Selection & Encoding

### ⚠️ PowerShell Unicode Encoding Issues

**The Problem:**
PowerShell has known issues with Unicode character handling when used with shell redirection (`2>&1`).
Commit messages with special characters (✓, ✗, →, •, etc.) cause:
```
git : To https://github.com/user/repo.git
At line:XX char:YY
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified (To https://github.com/...):String) [], RemoteException
    + FullyQualifiedNameId : NativeCommandError
```

**The Reality:**
- The error is **cosmetic only** - the git command still succeeds
- Commits are pushed successfully despite the error message
- But the error message creates confusion and looks unprofessional

---

### ✅ Solution 1: Use ASCII-Only Commit Messages (Recommended for all projects)

**Why this is the best approach:**
- Works everywhere (PowerShell, Git Bash, macOS, Linux)
- Professional appearance
- No encoding issues ever
- Commits are readable in all tools

**Update to commit format (v7):**

```markdown
Pre-Commit Checklist - Updated Format:

Commit Message Format:
  <type>: <description>
  
  <body with details>
  
  Backend Tests: X/X passed, 0 warnings [PASS]
  Manual Testing: [PASS] (for UI changes only)
    - [What you tested]
    - [Results]

Approved ASCII replacements:
  [PASS]  == previously ✓
  [FAIL]  == previously ✗
  [OK]    == previously ✓
  [DONE]  == previously ✓
  [TODO]  == previously ?
  [WAIT]  == previously ⏳
  ->      == previously →
  -       == previously •
```

**Example commits (updated format):**
```bash
# ✅ Good - ASCII only
git commit -m "feat: implement PDF export module

- Created core/pdf_export.py with export_mom_pdf() function
- Uses reportlab for monospaced text rendering
- Returns raw PDF bytes for Flask send_file() compatibility

Backend Tests: 151/151 passed, 0 warnings [PASS]"


# ❌ Avoid - Unicode characters
git commit -m "feat: implement PDF export module ✓"
```

---

### ✅ Solution 2: Use Git Bash (Recommended for development)

**Why Git Bash is better for git operations:**
- Native Unicode support (no encoding issues)
- Standard shell syntax works everywhere
- Part of Git for Windows installation
- No configuration needed
- More reliable than PowerShell for git

**How to use Git Bash:**

1. **Install Git for Windows** (if not already installed)
   - Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Installation includes Git Bash

2. **Open Git Bash** instead of PowerShell for git operations
   - Right-click in Explorer: "Git Bash Here"
   - Or launch from Start Menu: "Git Bash"

3. **Use standard bash commands:**
   ```bash
   cd "/c/Users/evanl/Documents/development workspace/clearmeet"
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: add PDF export [PASS]"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **No Unicode issues** - Git Bash handles all characters correctly

**Comparison:**

| Task | PowerShell | Git Bash |
|------|-----------|----------|
| ASCII commits | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| Unicode commits | ❌ Errors shown | ✅ Works perfectly |
| Standard shell syntax | ⚠️ Different | ✅ Standard |
| Line continuation | Semicolon (;) | Backslash (\) |
| Feel | Windows-specific | Universal |

---

### ✅ Solution 3: Configure PowerShell for UTF-8 (Advanced)

If you must use PowerShell, add UTF-8 support to your profile:

```powershell
# Edit your PowerShell profile
# Usually at: C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\PowerShell\profile.ps1

# Add these lines
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::UTF8
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = 'utf-8'
```

**Limitation:** Even with this, PowerShell's shell redirection (`2>&1`) can still cause issues. Better to avoid relying on this.

### 🎯 STANDARD FOR CLEARMEET: Git Bash is Required

**Effective immediately (February 19, 2026):**

Git Bash is the **REQUIRED** git tool for all ClearMeet development. This is not optional; it is a team standard.

**Why Git Bash is the standard for ClearMeet:**
- ✅ **Zero cosmetic errors** - No confusing error messages during commits
- ✅ **Professional appearance** - Clean git history without artifacts
- ✅ **Universal compatibility** - Works across all operating systems and environments
- ✅ **Culture of quality** - Demonstrates commitment to "no eyesores" philosophy
- ✅ **Team consistency** - Everyone uses the same tool, same experience
- ✅ **Future-proof** - Avoids PowerShell issues entirely, no workarounds needed
- ✅ **Built into Git** - No additional setup beyond standard Git for Windows

**This standard means:**
- When performing git operations (add, commit, push, pull, etc.), use Git Bash
- PowerShell is only for Python/Flask operations
- Development workflow: Python/Flask in PowerShell, Git operations in Git Bash
- This is a team commitment to quality, not an arbitrary restriction

---

### 📋 Setup Guide: Switching to Git Bash

**For ClearMeet contributors:**

1. **Verify Git for Windows is installed**
   ```powershell
   # In PowerShell, check git version
   git --version
   # Should show: git version 2.x.x.windows.1
   ```

2. **Locate Git Bash**
   - **Option A:** Right-click in Windows Explorer → "Git Bash Here"
   - **Option B:** Start Menu → Search "Git Bash" → Launch
   - **Option C:** From any terminal: `"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"`

3. **Set up Git Bash as your default for repo operations**
   - Create desktop shortcut to Git Bash pointing to the project folder
   - Or: Open Git Bash → `cd` to project folder → keep it open during development

4. **Daily workflow (Updated):**

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell - Python/Flask operations
   .\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python app.py
   python -m pytest
   ```

   ```bash
   # Git Bash - Git operations (NOT PowerShell)
   cd /c/Users/evanl/Documents/development\ workspace/clearmeet
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "docs: update audio upload security [PASS]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Avoid PowerShell for git operations**
   - ❌ PowerShell: `git commit -m "message" 2>&1` (may show cosmetic errors)
   - ✅ Git Bash: Same command works perfectly

---

### 🎨 Why This Reflects Our Quality Culture

**Values demonstrated by this standard:**
- **Highest Quality:** No compromises on appearance or professionalism
- **User Experience:** Clean output, no confusing error messages ("eyesores")
- **Team Consistency:** Everyone operates the same way
- **Preventive:** Avoid problems instead of working around them
- **Documentation:** This is written down, not assumed knowledge

**A single cosmetic error affects credibility:**
- User sees error messages even though everything works
- Creates doubt: "Is the commit really pushed?"
- Undermines professional appearance
- Prevents us from inculcating highest quality culture

**This standard says:** "We care enough to eliminate cosmetic issues. Quality matters in every detail."

---

### ✅ Alternative: ASCII-Only Commit Messages (For teams that insist on PowerShell)

If your team strongly prefers PowerShell and refuses Git Bash, **minimum requirement** is ASCII-only commit messages:

```markdown
Update to commit format (v7):

Commit Message Format:
  <type>: <description>
  
  <body with details>
  
  Backend Tests: X/X passed, 0 warnings [PASS]
  Manual Testing: [PASS] (for UI changes only)

Approved ASCII replacements ONLY:
  [PASS]  == previously ✓
  [FAIL]  == previously ✗
  [OK]    == previously ✓
  [DONE]  == previously ✓
```

**But note:** This approach still has the PowerShell redirection issue appear cosmetically.  
**Git Bash approach is superior** - Choose that instead.

---

### Updating Prime Directive

**ClearMeet team git requirements (non-negotiable):**
- ✅ **PRIMARY:** Use Git Bash for ALL git operations
- ✅ Use only ASCII characters in commit messages (no Unicode/emoji)
- ✅ Use approved ASCII replacements: `[PASS]`, `[FAIL]`, `[OK]`, `[DONE]`
- ✅ Document what was tested in commit message
- ✅ Include test count: "Backend Tests: X/X passed, 0 warnings [PASS]"
- ✅ For UI changes, include: "Manual Testing: [PASS]" with checklist items
- ✅ Never commit code with failing tests or warnings
